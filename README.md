### Project Description
The program is a web-based survey that assesses users' happiness, stress, anxiety, motivation, and satisfaction through a series of questions. After completion, it calculates a total score and provides personalized feedback and advice based on the user's responses. The final results help users understand their overall well-being and identify areas for improvement

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This is an important distinction, as users should be aware that the tool is not a diagnostic instrument and that seeking help from qualified professionals is crucial for serious mental health concerns.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A solution that nobody asked for in the mental health calculator could be an overly complex gamification system, such as points or levels, that distracts from the seriousness of mental health assessments. This could trivialize users' experiences and emotions, undermining the tool's purpose.
